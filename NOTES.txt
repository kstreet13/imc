Dr. Emamaullee

Meeting 11-11
-------------
R01 application
She has K thru NCI(?)
Funding for diverse investigators
Maybe better chance of funding
Transplant immunologist
Study immune rejection of implants
DDK funds most kidney research
NIAD thought NCI was better
She frames liver transplant as treatment option for liver cancer
IMC is cytof on tissue
25 marker panel (could have done more) focused on immune and structure (not so much cancer)
Can cluster cell types and visualize on cell mask
Find cell types more/less common in acute rejection/chronic rejection than no rejection
CHLA does 5-year follow-up biopsy to check for signs of rejection
Interested in predicting rejection based on blood-based assays
Aim 1: have 60 patients w/at least 3 biopsies
Some with single/multiple rejection episodes
Time-series analysis
Aim 2: expand blood analysis at multiple timepoints after biopsy
Multi-comic biomarker panel (3x cytof + IMC baseline)

IMC analysis - they published 11 marker panel
Image preprocessing (segmentation) is difficult, done by clinical cohort
Lots of fiddling with parameters
They're gonna write a methods paper for cleaning IMC method + python package
Sarah has a stats degree

Currently have data for 3 projects


IMC/CyTOF meeting 11/11
-----------------------
Juliet, Ariana, Sarah
IMC/cytof cleaning
Found a method with Matlab GUI (Bodenmiller?)
3 steps: cross-talk, noise, aggregates
Visualization to ensure you aren't removing signal
MCD (OMITIFF?) file, preprocessing requires TIFF image (python package for this)
Separate TIFF file for each marker
There is some normalization, then clustering
Supervised clustering (gating) to get large cell groups
Unsupervised clustering on groups to get sub clusters


Meeting 12/8/22
---------------
Scorpius for IMC data?
3 groups of patients: No rejection, acute rejection, chronic rejection
n=85
30 immune clusters + 8 non-immune
paper: Pseudotime subdivided into "pseudo-stage" groups
Want to see trajectories in different T-cell groups (CD4+, CD8+, ...)
Rejection is surprisingly consistent across patients
